# PopularMovies

This app needs an API key from https://www.themoviedb.org/ to function. 

Create a class named KeyKeeper.java in the directory: me/sivze/popularmovies/util

The class looks as follows:

public final class KeyKeeper { public static final String movieDBAPIkey = YOUR_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY; }
